a2,"It's a complicated story, old man,"" began Matvey Savitch, ""and if I were to tell you all just as it happened, it would take all night and more. Ten years ago in a little house in our street, next door to me, where now there's a tallow and oil factory, there was living an old widow, Marfa Semyonovna Kapluntsev, and she had two sons: one was a guard on the railway, but the other, Vasya, who was just my own age, lived at home with his mother. Old Kapluntsev had kept five pair of horses and sent carriers all over the town; his widow had not given up the business, but managed the carriers as well as her husband had done, so that some days they would bring in as much as five roubles from their rounds. The young fellow, too, made a trifle on his own account. He used to breed fancy pigeons and sell them to fanciers; at times he would stand for hours on the roof, waving a broom in the air and whistling; his pigeons were right up in the clouds, but it wasn't enough for him, and he'd want them to go higher yet. Siskins and starlings, too, he used to catch, and he made cages for sale. All trifles, but, mind you, he'd pick up some ten roubles a month over such trifles. Well, as time went on, the old lady lost the use of her legs and took to her bed.","Summary: The story is about an old widow, Marfa Semyonovna Kapluntsev, who lived in a small house with her two sons, one of whom, Vasya, was the same age as the narrator, Matvey Savitch.Enunciation: Third-person narrativeTone: Informal, conversationalGenre: Realistic fictionSpeech standard: StandardLiterary form: Prose narrativeActive characters: Matvey Savitch, Marfa Semyonovna Kapluntsev, VasyaFuzzy time: 10 years agoFuzzy place: A small house in a street, next to a tallow and oil factory"
a7,"Of course he would come at his own odd hours, often just as one was dressing to go out and dine, and I can even remember finding him there when I returned, for I had long since given him a key of the flat. It was the inhospitable month of February, and I can recall more than one cosy evening when we discussed anything and everything but our own malpractices; indeed, there were none to discuss just then. Raffles, on the contrary, was showing himself with some industry in the most respectable society, and by his advice I used the club more than ever. There is nothing like it at this time of year,"" said he. ""In the summer I have my cricket to provide me with decent employment in the sight of men. Keep yourself before the public from morning to night, and they'll never think of you in the still small hours."""" Our behavior, in fine, had so long been irreproachable that I rose without misgiving on the morning of Lord Thornaby's dinner to the other Criminologists and guests. My chief anxiety was to arrive under the 忙gis of my brilliant friend, and I had begged him to pick me up on his way; but at five minutes to the appointed hour there was no sign of Raffles or his cab. We were bidden at a quarter to eight for eight o'clock, so after all I had to hurry off alone.","Summary: The story follows the narrator, who is a friend of Raffles, as they navigate their involvement in criminal activities while maintaining a respectable public image.

a79,"But the fan-girl led the way with the lamp swinging in her hand, as one accustomed to the mazes. Here she doubled, there she turned, and here she stopped in the middle of a blank wall to push a stone, which swung to let us pass. And once she pressed at the corner of a flagstone on the floor, which reared up to the thrust of her foot, and showed us a stair steep and narrow. That we descended, coming to the foot of an inclined way which led us upward again; and so by degrees we came unto the chamber which had been given for my use. There is raiment in all these chests which stand by the walls,"" said the girl, """"and jewels and gauds in that bronze coffer. They are Phorenice's first presents, she bid me say, and but a small earnest of what is to come. My Lord Deucalion can drop his simplicity now, and fig himself out in finery to suit the fashion.""""

If my Lord Deucalion thinks this a rudeness, he can give a word to Phorenice, and I shall be whipped.","Summary: The story follows a fan-girl who leads a character named Deucalion through a maze-like underground passage to a chamber filled with luxurious items, which she says are gifts from Phorenice.

a85,"Before even she could see it she heard the hollow bumping of a large boat against its rotten posts, and heard also the murmur of whispered conversation in that boat whose white paint and great dimensions, faintly visible on nearer approach, made her rightly guess that it belonged to the brig just anchored. Stopping her course by a rapid motion of her paddle, with another swift stroke she sent it whirling away from the wharf and steered for a little rivulet which gave access to the back courtyard of the house. She landed at the muddy head of the creek and made her way towards the house over the trodden grass of the courtyard. To the left, from the cooking shed, shone a red glare through the banana plantation she skirted, and the noise of feminine laughter reached her from there in the silent evening. She rightly judged her mother was not near, laughter and Mrs. Almayer not being close neighbours. She must be in the house, thought Nina, as she ran lightly up the inclined plane of shaky planks leading to the back door of the narrow passage dividing the house in two. Outside the doorway, in the black shadow, stood the faithful Ali. Who is there?""","Summary: The story describes a woman named Nina who arrives at a house by boat and makes her way to the back door, where she encounters a servant named Ali.

a364,"Captain Amyas Preston and Captain Sommers, the colonist of the Bermudas, or Sommers' Islands, will land, with a force tiny enough, though larger far than Leigh's, where Leigh dare not land; and taking the fort of Guayra, will find, as Leigh found, that their coming has been expected, and that the Pass of the Venta, three thousand feet above, has been fortified with huge barricadoes, abattis, and cannon, making the capital, amid its ring of mountain-walls, impregnable to all but Englishmen or Zouaves. For up that seven thousand feet of precipice, which rises stair on stair behind the town, those fierce adventurers will climb hand over hand, through rain and fog, while men lie down, and beg their officers to kill them, for no farther can they go. Yet farther they will go, hewing a path with their swords through woods of wild plantain, and rhododendron thickets, over (so it seems, however incredible) the very saddle of the Silla,* down upon the astonished """"Mantuanos"""" of St. Jago, driving all before them; and having burnt the city in default of ransom, will return triumphant by the right road, and pass along the coast, the masters of the deep. * Humboldt says that there is a path from Caravellada to St. Jago, between the peaks, used by smugglers.","Summary: The story describes the daring exploits of Captain Amyas Preston and Captain Sommers, who lead a small force to capture the fort of Guayra, scale the treacherous mountain pass, and sack the city of St. Jago, before returning triumphantly along the coast.

a799,"He wanted to walk round the box but his feet would not move and his new clean goloshes had grown to the stone floor, and he could neither lift them nor get his feet out of the goloshes. Then the taper-box was no longer a box but a bed, and suddenly Vasili Andreevich saw himself lying in his bed at home. He was lying in his bed and could not get up. Yet it was necessary for him to get up because Ivan Matveich, the police-officer, would soon call for him and he had to go with him either to bargain for the forest or to put Mukhorty's breeching straight. He asked his wife: 'Nikolaevna, hasn't he come yet?' 'No, he hasn't,' she replied. He heard someone drive up to the front steps. 'It must be him.' 'No, he's gone past.' 'Nikolaevna! I say, Nikolaevna, isn't he here yet?' 'No.' He was still lying on his bed and could not get up, but was always waiting. And this waiting was uncanny and yet joyful. Then suddenly his joy was completed. He whom he was expecting came; not Ivan Matveich the police-officer, but someone else yet it was he whom he had been waiting for. He came and called him; and it was he who had called him and told him to lie down on Nikita.","Summary: The story is about a man named Vasili Andreevich who is unable to get up from his bed, waiting for someone to arrive, and experiencing a surreal, dreamlike state.

a3153,"He seemed so bright and happy, in spite of his lameness, which kept him from running about like other young men. He looked a little older than Miss Laura, and one day, a week or two later, when they were sitting on the veranda, I heard him tell her that he was just nineteen. He told her, too, that his lameness made him love animals. They never laughed at him, or slighted him, or got impatient, because he could not walk quickly. They were always good to him, and he said he loved all animals while he liked very few people. On this day as he was limping along, he said to Mrs. Wood: """"I am getting more absent-minded every day. Have you heard of my latest escapade?"""" No,"" she said. I am glad,"" he replied. ""I was afraid that it would be all over the village by this time. I went to church last Sunday with my poor guinea pig in my pocket. He hasn't been well, and I was attending to him before church, and put him in there to get warm, and forgot about him. Unfortunately I was late, and the back seats were all full, so I had to sit farther up than I usually do. During the first hymn I happened to strike Piggy against the side of the seat. Such an ear-splitting squeal as he set up. It sounded as if I was murdering him.","Summary: The story is about a young man with a limp who loves animals, particularly a guinea pig that he accidentally took to church and caused a disruption.

a415,"She has always been glad enough to get our kings to make war on England whenever she wanted a diversion made, but she has never put herself out of the way to return the favour. It has been a one sided alliance all along. Scotland has for centuries been sending some of her best blood to fight as soldiers in France, but with a few exceptions no Frenchman has ever drawn his sword for Scotland. No, I am inclined to think you are right, Ronald, and especially after what we saw at Fontenoy I have no wish ever to draw sword again against the English, and am willing to be the best friends in the world with them if they will but let us Scots have our own king and go away peacefully. I don't want to force Prince Charles upon them if they will but let us have him for ourselves. If they won't, you know, it is they who are responsible for the quarrel, not us."""" That is one way of putting it, certainly,"" Ronald laughed. ""I am afraid after having been one kingdom since King James went to London, they won't let us go our own way without making an effort to keep us; but here is a crossroad, we will strike off here and make for the west."""" They avoided the towns on their routes, for although they felt certain that they were ahead of any messengers who might be sent out with orders for their arrest, they knew that they might be detained for some little time at Nantes, and were therefore anxious to leave no clue of their passage in that direction. On the evening of the third day after starting they approached their destination. On the first morning after leaving Versailles they had halted in wood a short distance from Chartres, and Malcolm had ridden in alone and had purchased a suit of citizen's clothes for Ronald, as the latter's uniform as an officer of the Scotch Dragoons would at once have attracted notice. Henceforward, whenever they stopped, Malcolm had taken an opportunity to mention to the stable boy that he was accompanying his master, the son of an advocate of Paris, on a visit to some relatives in La Vendee. This story he repeated at the inn where they put up at Nantes. The next morning Malcolm went round to all the inns in the town, but could hear nothing of the Duke of Athole, so he returned at noon with the news of his want of success. They may have hired a private lodging to avoid observation,"" Ronald said, """"or, not improbably, may have taken another name. The best thing we can do is to go down to the river side, inquire what vessels are likely to leave port soon, and then, if we see anyone going off to them, to accost them. We may hear of them in that way."""" Accordingly they made their way down to the river.","Summary: The story is about two men, Ronald and Malcolm, who are trying to avoid detection as they travel to meet the Duke of Athole, possibly to assist Prince Charles. They take precautions to avoid being recognized along the way.

a438,"At the moment he looked to me convincingly tired, gone slack all over, like a man who has passed through some sort of crisis. I have had a lot of urgent writing to do,"" he added. I rose from my chair at once, and he followed my example, without haste, a little heavily. I must apologize for detaining you so long,"" I said. Why apologize? One can't very well go to bed before night. And you did not detain me. I could have left you at any time."""" I had not stayed with him to be offended. I am glad you have been sufficiently interested,"" I said calmly. ""No merit of mine, though the commonest sort of regard for the mother of your friend was enough.... As to Miss Haldin herself, she at one time was disposed to think that her brother had been betrayed to the police in some way."""" To my great surprise Mr. Razumov sat down again suddenly. I stared at him, and I must say that he returned my stare without winking for quite a considerable time. In some way,"" he mumbled, as if he had not understood or could not believe his ears. Some unforeseen event, a sheer accident might have done that,"" I went on. """"Or, as she characteristically put it to me, the folly or weakness of some unhappy fellow-revolutionist."""" Folly or weakness,"" he repeated bitterly. She is a very generous creature,"" I observed after a time. The man admired by Victor Haldin fixed his eyes on the ground. I turned away and moved off, apparently unnoticed by him. I nourished no resentment of the moody brusqueness with which he had treated me. The sentiment I was carrying away from that conversation was that of hopelessness. Before I had got fairly clear of the raft of chairs and tables he had rejoined me. H'm, yes!"" I heard him at my elbow again. ""But what do you think?"" I did not look round even. I think that you people are under a curse."" He made no sound. It was only on the pavement outside the gate that I heard him again. I should like to walk with you a little."" After all, I preferred this enigmatical young man to his celebrated compatriot, the great Peter Ivanovitch. But I saw no reason for being particularly gracious. I am going now to the railway station, by the shortest way from here, to meet a friend from England,"""" I said, for all answer to his unexpected proposal. I hoped that something informing could come of it. As we stood on the curbstone waiting for a tramcar to pass, he remarked gloomily  I like what you said just now."" Do you?"" We stepped off the pavement together. The great problem,"" he went on, ""is to understand thoroughly the nature of the curse."""" That's not very difficult, I think.""","Summary: The story is about a conversation between two men, one of whom appears to be tired and has been doing urgent writing, while the other is a friend of Victor Haldin who is discussing the possibility of Haldin being betrayed to the police.

a447,"Only he never reached the Captain. In the very act of falling Jellico had pulled his legs under him so that he was not supine but crouched, and his net swept but at ground level, clipping the I-S man about the shins, entangling his feet so that he crashed heavily to the sod and lay still. The whip that Lalox whip trick!"" Wilcox's voice rose triumphantly above the babble of the crowd. Using his net as if it had been a thong, Jellico had brought down the Eysie with a move the other had not foreseen. Breathing hard, sweat running down his shoulders and making tracks through the powdery red dust which streaked him, Jellico got to his feet and walked over to the I-S champion who had not moved or made a sound since his fall. The Captain went down on one knee to examine him. Kill! Kill!"" That was the Salariki, all their instinctive savagery aroused. But Jellico spoke to Groft. """"By our customs we do not kill the conquered. Let his friends bear him hence."""" He took the claw knife the Eysie still clutched in his hand and thrust it into his own belt. Then he faced the I-S party and Kallee. Take your man and get out!"" The rein he had kept on his temper these past days was growing very thin. """"You've made your last play here."""" Kallee's thick lips drew back in something close to a Salarik snarl. But neither he nor his men made any reply. They bundled up their unconscious fighter and disappeared. Of their own return to the sanctuary of the Queen Dane had only the dimmest of memories afterwards. He had made the privacy of the forest road before he yielded to the demands of his outraged interior. And after that he had stumbled along with Van Rycke's hand under his arm, knowing from other miserable sounds that he was not alone in his torment. It was some time later, months he thought when he first roused, that he found himself lying in his bunk, feeling very weak and empty as if a large section of his middle had been removed, but also at peace with his world. As he levered himself up the cabin had a nasty tendency to move slowly to the right as if he were a pivot on which it swung, and he had all the sensations of being in free fall though the Queen was still firmly planeted. But that was only a minor discomfort compared to the disturbance he remembered. Fed the semi-liquid diet prescribed by Tau and served up by Mura to him and his fellow sufferers, he speedily got back his strength. But it had been a close call, he did not need Tau's explanation to underline that. Weeks had suffered the least of the four, he the most though none of them had had an easy time. And they had been out of circulation three days.","Summary: The story describes a confrontation between Jellico and an I-S champion, where Jellico uses a clever move to bring down the I-S man. Afterwards, Jellico spares the I-S champion's life and sends him away, despite the Salariki's calls for killing the conquered. The narrator then recounts the aftermath, where he and others suffered from some kind of disturbance or illness.
